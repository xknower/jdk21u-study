 * <b>Null-handling</b>
 * <p>
 * All methods define whether they accept or return {@code null} in the Javadoc.
 * Typically this is expressed as {@code "not null"}. If a {@code null}
 * parameter is used where it is not allowed, a
 * {@code java.lang.NullPointerException} is thrown. If a {@code null}
 * parameters is passed to a method that throws other exceptions, such as
 * {@code java.io.IOException}, the {@code java.lang.NullPointerException} takes
 * precedence, unless the Javadoc for the method explicitly states how
 * {@code null} is handled, i.e. by throwing {@code java.lang.IllegalArgumentException}.
