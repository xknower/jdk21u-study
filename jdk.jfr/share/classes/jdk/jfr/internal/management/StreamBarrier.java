/**
 * Purpose of this class is to provide a synchronization point when stopping a
 * recording. Without it, a race can happen where a stream advances beyond the
 * last chunk of the recording.
 *
 * Code that is processing the stream calls check() and Unless the recording is
 * in the process of being stopped, it will just return. On the other hand, if
 * the recording is stopping, the thread waits and when it wakes up an end
 * position should have been set (last chunk position) beyond which the stream
 * processing should not continue.
