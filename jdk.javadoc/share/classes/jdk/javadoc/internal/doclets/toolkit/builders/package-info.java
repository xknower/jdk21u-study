/**
 * This doclet-independent package has a set of classes and
 * interfaces that are the building blocks for doclets. They
 * define the basic structure of doclets and make doclet
 * writing much easier because they provide the content generation
 * code to be shared among different doclets. Builders only provide
 * the structure and content of API documentation.
 * They do not directly provide any style markup.
