/**
 * A type metadata is an object that can be stapled on a type. This is typically done using
 * {@link Type#addMetadata(TypeMetadata)}. Metadata associated to a type can also be removed,
 * typically using {@link Type#dropMetadata(Class)}. To drop <em>all</em> metadata from a given type,
 * the {@link Type#baseType()} method can also be used. This can be useful when comparing two
 * using reference equality (see also {@link Type#equalsIgnoreMetadata(Type)}).
 * <p>
 * There are no constraints on how a type metadata should be defined. Typically, a type
 * metadata will be defined as a small record, storing additional information (see {@link ConstantValue}).
 * In other cases, type metadata can be mutable and support complex state transitions
 * (see {@link Annotations}).
 * <p>
 * The only invariant the implementation requires is that there must be <em>one</em> metadata
 * of a given kind attached to a type, as this makes accessing and dropping metadata simpler.
 * If clients wish to store multiple metadata values that are logically related, they should
 * define a metadata type that collects such values in e.g. a list.
