/**
 * An object that creates new threads on demand.  Using thread factories
 * removes hardwiring of calls to {@link Thread#Thread(Runnable) new Thread},
 * enabling applications to use special thread subclasses, priorities, etc.
 *
 * <p>
 * The simplest implementation of this interface is just:
 * <pre> {@code
 * class SimpleThreadFactory implements ThreadFactory {
 *   public Thread newThread(Runnable r) {
 *     return new Thread(r);
 *   }
 * }}</pre>
 *
 * The {@link Executors#defaultThreadFactory} method provides a more
 * useful simple implementation, that sets the created thread context
 * to known values before returning it.
