/**
 * Thrown to indicate an unexpected failure in pattern matching.
 *
 * <p>{@code MatchException} may be thrown when an exhaustive pattern matching
 * language construct (such as a {@code switch} expression) encounters a value
 * that does not match any of the specified patterns at run time, even though
 * the construct has been deemed exhaustive. This is intentional and can arise
 * from a number of cases:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>Separate compilation anomalies, where parts of the type hierarchy that
 *         the patterns reference have been changed, but the pattern matching
 *         construct has not been recompiled. For example, if a sealed interface
 *         has a different set of permitted subtypes at run time than it had at
 *         compile time, or if an enum class has a different set of enum constants
 *         at runtime than it had at compile time, or if the type hierarchy has
 *         been changed in some incompatible way between compile time and run time.</li>
 *
 *     <li>{@code null} values and nested patterns involving sealed classes. If,
 *         for example, an interface {@code I} is {@code sealed} with two permitted
 *         subclasses {@code A} and {@code B}, and a record class {@code R} has a
 *         single component of type {@code I}, then the two record patterns {@code
 *         R(A a)} and {@code R(B b)} together are considered to be exhaustive for
 *         the type {@code R}, but neither of these patterns will match against the
 *         result of {@code new R(null)}.</li>
 *
 *     <li>{@code null} values and nested record patterns. Given a record class
 *         {@code S} with a single component of type {@code T}, where {@code T} is
 *         another record class with a single component of type {@code String},
 *         then the nested record pattern {@code R(S(var s))} is considered
 *         exhaustive for the type {@code R} but it does not match against the
 *         result of {@code new R(null)} (whereas it does match against the result
 *         of {@code new R(new S(null))} does).</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>{@code MatchException} may also be thrown by the process of pattern matching
 * a value against a pattern. For example, pattern matching involving a record
 * pattern may require accessor methods to be implicitly invoked in order to
 * extract the component values. If any of these accessor methods throws an
 * exception, pattern matching completes abruptly and throws {@code
 * MatchException}. The original exception will be set as a {@link
 * Throwable#getCause() cause} of the {@code MatchException}. No {@link
 * Throwable#addSuppressed(java.lang.Throwable) suppressed} exceptions will be
 * recorded.
