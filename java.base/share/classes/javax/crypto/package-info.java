/**
 * Provides the classes and interfaces for cryptographic
 * operations. The cryptographic operations defined in this package
 * include encryption, key generation and key agreement, and Message
 * Authentication Code (MAC) generation.
 *
 * <p>Support for encryption includes symmetric, asymmetric, block,
 * and stream ciphers. This package also supports secure streams and
 * sealed objects.
 *
 * <p>Many of the classes provided in this package are provider-based.
 * The class itself defines a programming interface to which
 * applications may write.  The implementations themselves may then be
 * written by independent third-party vendors and plugged in
 * seamlessly as needed.  Therefore, application developers may take
 * advantage of any number of provider-based implementations without
 * having to add or rewrite code.
