/**
 * The CharacterRangeTable attribute is an optional variable-length attribute in
 * the attributes table of a {@code Code} attribute. It may be used by debuggers
 * to determine which part of the Java virtual machine code array corresponds to
 * a given position in the source file or to determine what section of source
 * code corresponds to a given index into the code array. The
 * CharacterRangeTable attribute consists of an array of character range entries.
 * Each character range entry within the table associates a range of indices in
 * the code array with a range of character indices in the source file. If the
 * source file is viewed as an array of characters, a character index is the
 * corresponding index into this array. Note that character indices are not the
 * same as byte indices as multi-byte characters may be present in the source
 * file. Each character range entry includes a flag which indicates what kind of
 * range is described: statement, assignment, method call, etc. Both code index
 * ranges and character ranges may nest within other ranges, but they may not
 * partially overlap. Thus, a given code index may correspond to several
 * character range entries and in turn several character ranges, but there will
 * be a smallest character range, and for each kind of range in which it is
 * enclosed there will be a smallest character range. Similarly, a given
 * character index may correspond to several character range entries and in turn
 * several code index ranges, but there will be a smallest code index range, and
 * for each kind of range in which it is enclosed there will be a smallest code
 * index range. The character range entries may appear in any order.
